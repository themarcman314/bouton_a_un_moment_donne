## Flash firmware
Open `.ino` file with the arduino ide and click the arrow pointing right to flash.

## Usage
1. Connect to the WPA with Wi-Fi enabled device.
SSID name is `fbi_van`

2. Portal with the configuration page should open automatically.
If not just go to `192.168.1.1` or any ip at all really.

3. Upload small mp3 files (900 kB or smaller works well)

## TODO :
- Add more CSS for ugly buttons
- Make page adjust dynamically (for phones)
- Disable I2S pins after playing sound
- Fix overall bugs
- Finish hardware prototype
